		        <h2>Atari and Amiga</h2>
		        <p>Through their technically-advanced, cutting-edge production capabilities, the Atari and Amiga computers transformed the landscape of music, video, and culture. These early devices gifted aspiring musicians, artists, and designers affordable tools to further expand the potentials of rave culture. With remarkably developed software programs, the computers came ready to equip musicians with capacities to electronically sequence sounds, breaking boundaries and fostering experimentation unheard of in music. This experimentation, facilitated by the computers’ innovative capabilities, was instrumental in shaping 90s rave culture.</p>

		        <h2>Video Toaster and More</h2>
		        <p>Similarly, the Video Toaster brought about a revolution in video production by making technically-advanced capabilities accessible to wider audiences of bedroom producers and a new generation of digital “DIY” artists. Its affordability and expansive production features meant that more people outside of the few large, professional production companies could contribute their talents to the futures of visual culture. These enhanced production capabilities provided creatives with more freedom to visually articulate their ideas and content. In early rave culture, this resulted in visually perplexing event flyers, record sleeves, and VJ mixes that further elevated the electronic music being produced at the same time.</p>
